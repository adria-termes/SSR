					<h2>What is SSR?</h2>
					<p>Salvar al Soldado Rockefeller is a personal project that combines curiosity, fun and humour regarding all that is around the business world. Here you can find different opinion topics that are connected to the business world, as well as other content that has been defined to show the opinion of some business students in another way: with fun to better depict what we have seen as the real reality of what is told in business schools.</p>

					

					<h2>What will be in it for you?</h2>

					<p>The project will be divided into 2 sections: one that is about serious business issues and based on serious research, and the other one that is based on criticism for the business world and business schools based on firsthand experiences.</p>
